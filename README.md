# Implementation of ITU-T Recommendation G.1072 

This repo provides the implementation of ITU-T G.1072 "Opinion model predicting gaming quality of experience for cloud gaming services" based on network and comperession parameters. 

- The G.1072 Planning model can predict the cloud gaming video quality based on the video paramters, bitrate, framerate, encoding resolution, gaming video complexity and network parameters, packetloss, delay. 

## How to Use
In order to run the code please use run it based on the parameters of the model as follows:

- Test the model based on the parameters, which requires specifying all video parameters, bitrate, framerate, ecoding resolution (width x height,e.g. 1920x1080) and video complexity (Vcomplexity) level ('High','Medium' ,'Low') and network parameters packetloss (if freezing is the effect), packetlossUDP (if slicing is the packet loss effect), delay and delay (interaction) complexity (Icomplexity) .  To do so, you can run it as the following example:

```
    python G1072.py --bitrate=50  --framerate=60  
                    --packetloss=0 --packetlossUDP=0 
                    --delay=400 --coding_res=1920x1080  
                    --Icomplexity=High --Vcomplexity=High  
                    --test_type=parameters
```

 For more help run:
 ```
    python test.py -h
```

### Application Range of Parameters 

Please note that the model only works based on the range of parameters used for training the model. 
- Bitrate: 0.3 kbps to 50 Mbps
- Framerate: 10 fps to 60 fps
- Resolution: 1920x1080, 1280x720 or 640Ã—480
- Video Complexity Class: High, Medium, Low
- Interaction Sensitivity Class: High, Medium, Low
- Packetloss (Freezing effect): 0 - 0.5
- Packetloss (Slicing effect): 0 - 0.5
- Delay: 0 - 400


### Output of the model
The model gives you four estimations: 
- Overall Quality
- Interaction Quality (known as Input Quality in G,1072)
- Video Fragementation (based on https://github.com/stootaghaj/GamingVQA)
- Video Unclearness (based on https://github.com/stootaghaj/GamingVQA)

#### Example 
 ```
    python G1072.py --bitrate=50  --framerate=60  
                    --packetloss=0 --packetlossUDP=0 
                    --delay=400 --coding_res=1920x1080  
                    --Icomplexity=High --Vcomplexity=High  
                    --test_type=parameters
 ```
Output: 

 ```
    ('Overal Quality:', 4.582801247415103)
    ('Quality of Interaction Quality:', 4.6229955301830845)
    ('Video Unclearness:', 4.607621778600887)
    ('Video Fragmentation:', 4.471200161599724)
 ```
